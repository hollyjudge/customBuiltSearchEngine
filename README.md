# Search Engine for Electronic Theses and Dissertations

The aim of this project is to design and implement a usable search engine that can be accessed through a web portal. 
The search engine will be used to index and search electronic theses and dissertations. 
The searching of electronic theses and dissertations is paramount to the success of any academic and as a result the tools required to access these documents should be efficient, accessible, and user friendly. 
This search engine uses a client-server architecture with Apache SOLR providing the server-side functions of searching and indexing and Django providing support for user interaction and user interfacing. 
The search engine proved to be both fast and precise with a high degree of relevant documents returned. 
This search engine architecture can be used in any setting to abstract the processes of searching large collections of textual data.
